# Detailed Notes for CFA Level 1

## I. Economics

### A. Time Value of Money
1. Interested Rate  
(1) Interest rate = nominal risk-free rate + risk premium  
(2) nominal risk-free rate = real risk-free rate (t-bill rate) + inflation rate  
(3) risk premium = default risk premium + liquidity risk premium + maturity risk premium  

2. Effective Annual Rate
lim(1+1/n)^n = e
Continuous compounding EAR = e^r - 1

3. Annuity  
(1) Ordinary annuity  
(2) Annuity due  
(3) Perpetuity P = A/r  
(4) Geometric Sequence Formula

### B. Statistics

1. Measurement scale (Weak -->> strong)  
(1) Nominal scale  
(2) Ordinal scale: sort data into categories  
(3) Interval scale: equal difference between scale values. Additive and subtractive  
(4) Ratio scale: true zero point, additive, subtractive, mutiplitive, dividitive  

2. Frequency Distribution
(1) Absolute Frequency  
(2) Cumulative Absolute Frequency
(3) Relative Frequencies  
(4) Cumulative Relative Frequencies

3. Quant Description of Distribution  
(1) Central tendency (return centered)  
(2) Dispersion (standard deviation)  
(3) Skewness  
(4) Kurtosis  
(5) Moment E(x-Ex)^k *Central tendency: Ex = 0

4. Mean  
(1) Arithmetic Mean  
(2) Weighted Mean: sum(Wi) = 1, Wi can be negative(short) or greater than 1(leverage)  
(3) Geometric Mean: G = n_rt(X1X2...Xn)  
* (4) Geometric Periodic Return: R = n_rt[(1+r1)(1+r2)...(1+rn)]-1  
(5) Harmonic Mean: N/(sum(1/Xi)) use when absolute spent amount are the same, eg. $100 to buy three stocks, $10/share, $20/share, $30/share  
(6) Harmonic Mean <= Geometric Mean <= Rithmetic Mean  
* (7) Equal sign only happens when all data are the same
* (8) Dispersion: Greater variability, the more the discrapancies between different means
